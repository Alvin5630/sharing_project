HE is a 58 year old white \\nmale retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  \\n1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was \\nexcised \\nat the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed \\nnonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does \\nvolunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or \\natypical mycobacteria.  \\n2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed \\nat the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was \\nbenign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  \\n3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the \\nlast \\n2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism \\n10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because \\nof his alcoholism.

His woman friend \\nis very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself \\nthat he is ready to try and get work full time.

Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? \\nthroat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she \\ndied of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last \\nyear and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also \\nhas mitral valve disease. \\n \\nPast medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in \\n2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. \\n \\nHe has no known allergies to medications.\\n \\nThe only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was \\nonly started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.\\n \\nHis other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.

His live in \\nlover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance \\nand so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He \\nhas no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  \\n \\nSocial Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a \\nday.  \\nHe does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has \\nfor many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do \\nany elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He \\nalways had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is \\nvery deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is \\nabout \\na teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no \\nangina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has \\nno dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel \\nmovements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no \\njoint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has \\nno \\nheat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  \\n \\nPE: shows him to 5\\'7\".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early \\nclubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally \\nround and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs \\nnormal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. \\nThyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under \\nthe \\nmandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the \\nsupraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant \\nbreath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and \\nholosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. \\nNo \\nradiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 \\nsonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the \\nliver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank \\nhernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult \\nfeel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult \\nfor me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was \\nnormal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout \\nand normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.\\n \\nAssessment and Plan:\\n \\n1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating \\ngranuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early \\nnext week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and \\nget culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to \\nrule out a cavitary lesion.  \\n2)  Alcoholism now sober.\\n3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and \\ninstructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  \\n4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.\\n5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some \\nWellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I \\nencouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and \\nquit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him \\nagain in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the \\nchest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.\\n \\nLeroy X.

He took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the \\ntesting wont be done until tomorrow.  Thyroid function tests were \\ncompletely normal.  His chest x-ray is completely normal except for \\ntracheal deviation I believe which is due to his goida.  I talked to him \\nthat if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate.  I also \\nsaid to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.  Though \\nslightly anxious he is agreeable to this.\\n \\nHe did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node \\nbiopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further \\nfollow-up or treatment was necessary.\\nWe then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked \\na date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement \\nfor that as I could.\\n \\nLeroy X.

Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnother possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.\\n\\n\\n\\n1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.
